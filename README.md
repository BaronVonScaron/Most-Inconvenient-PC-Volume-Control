# Most-Inconvenient-PC-Volume-Control
This python app lets you alter your main pc volume! To do so enter in a number, the square root of the number will be the volume. The app is purposely fully ugly and this is probably the most pointless thing ever. But its a good starter project in my opinion and it was fun to make, I learned a lot actually doing it :D
