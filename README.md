# Most-Inconvenient-PC-Volume-Control

This python app lets you alter your main pc volume! To do so enter in a number, the square root of the number will be the volume. The app is purposely fully ugly and this is probably the most pointless thing ever. But its a good starter project in my opinion and it was fun to make, I actually learned alot doing this to be honest. It was fun and I am going to work on more, the main purpose of this weird project was my submission for my final for Codedex. PLEASE CERTIFY ME!!!
